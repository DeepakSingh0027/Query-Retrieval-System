    "Non-infective Arthritis is covered after a waiting period of two years of continuous coverage from the date of inception of the first policy, as it is listed in Table A under 'Specific Disease/Procedure Waiting Period'. This waiting period does not apply for claims arising due to an accident.",
    "No, you cannot raise a claim for Hydrocele immediately after renewal. According to the policy, expenses related to the treatment of Hydrocele are subject to a two-year waiting period from the date of inception of the first policy. However, since you have been a customer for the last 6 years (i.e., you have had continuous coverage for more than two years), the waiting period for Hydrocele has already been completed. Therefore, you are eligible to raise a claim for Hydrocele under your policy.",
    "Expenses incurred in connection with voluntary medical termination of pregnancy during the first twelve weeks from the date of conception are not covered. Additionally, medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) are excluded except for ectopic pregnancy. Expenses towards miscarriage (unless due to an accident) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy during the policy period are also excluded. Therefore, abortion is generally not covered except when it is due to an accident or is an ectopic pregnancy."

    "The provided document does not specifically address the classification of cases such as car theft under the law. It mainly discusses the powers and jurisdictions of courts, fundamental rights, and other constitutional provisions. Therefore, it does not provide an explicit answer regarding the legal categorization of car theft cases.",
    "The document states in Article 22(1) that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. Article 22(2) further states that every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest (excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate) and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. The document does not state that arrest without a warrant is illegal, but it does provide safeguards that must be followed if a person is arrested, including being informed of the grounds of arrest, the right to consult a lawyer, and being produced before a magistrate within 24 hours. Therefore, arrest without a warrant is not per se illegal as long as these constitutional safeguards are followed.",
    "No, that is not allowed. According to the document, 'No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.' Therefore, being denied a job because of your caste is prohibited.",
    "Based on the provided document, if the government acquires land (such as for a public project), the law providing for such acquisition cannot be deemed void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or abridges rights conferred by Article 14 or Article 19. However, if the land is personally cultivated and within the ceiling limit, the State cannot acquire it unless the law provides for compensation at a rate not less than the market value. Therefore, you cannot generally stop the government from acquiring your land if the acquisition is according to law and compensation provisions are met, but there are protections regarding compensation and certain holdings.",
    "No, it is not legal. According to Article 24 of the Constitution of India, no child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.",
    "Yes, if you are a citizen, being stopped from speaking at a protest may be against your rights. According to Article 19(1)(a) of the document, all citizens have the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, this right is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the State in the interests of public order, morality, and other grounds as specified by law.",
    "No, it is not constitutional. Article 15(2) of the provided document states that no citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction, or condition with regard to access to places of public resort, including those dedicated to the use of the general public. Additionally, Article 15(3) allows the State to make special provisions for women and children, but does not permit discrimination against women. Therefore, a religious place stopping you from entering solely because you are a woman would violate the right to equality and prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex.",
    "Based on the provided document, every person has the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion (Article 25). The government cannot stop you from changing your religion, as the right to choose and practice any religion is protected. However, the State may regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political, or other secular activity associated with religious practice, but not the freedom to choose or change one's religion itself.",
    "If the police torture someone in custody, the right being violated is Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which provides protection of life and personal liberty, stating that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Additionally, Article 20(3) protects against self-incrimination, and Article 22 provides protection against arbitrary arrest and detention.",
    "Yes, you can take action. According to the document, no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. This means it is unconstitutional for a public university to deny you admission solely because you are from a backward community. You have the right to challenge this denial, for example, by filing a complaint or taking legal action."

  ],
  "allAnswers": [
    "Newton defines the 'quantity of motion' as the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. The motion of the whole is the sum of the motions of all the parts; therefore, in a body double in quantity, with equal velocity, the motion is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple. This is distinct from 'force', which Newton treats in various forms (absolute, accelerative, motive) as the cause that changes the quantity of motion, either by generating or destroying it. Thus, 'quantity of motion' refers to the product of mass and velocity (momentum), while 'force' is the agent that alters this motion.",
    "According to the document, Newton's three laws of motion are as follows: (1) Bodies preserve their motion, both progressive and circular, for much longer in free spaces with less resistance (Law I); (2) The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed, and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, and the resulting motion is added to or subtracted from the previous motion depending on the directions (Law II); (3) The mutual actions of bodies and the resulting motions and forces are considered, especially those that relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, and resistance of fluids, whether attractive or impulsive (Law III). In celestial mechanics, these laws are used to analyze the motions of planets, comets, and other celestial bodies by considering their motions as resulting from the forces (primarily gravity) acting upon them. Newton applies these laws to explain phenomena such as planetary orbits, lunar motion, and the mutual attractions of bodies in the solar system, deducing the motions of celestial bodies from the forces acting between them, particularly the force of gravity which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between bodies.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law—that a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times—from his laws of motion and gravitation by showing that the force which retains a planet in its orbit is always directed to the sun (centripetal force). By the first law of Kepler, the proportionality of the areas to the times of their description indicates that the force acting on the planet is directed towards the sun. Newton demonstrates that if a planet is acted upon by a force directed towards a focus (the sun) and this force varies inversely as the square of the distance, then the planet's motion will necessarily result in the radius vector sweeping out areas proportional to the times. This follows from his demonstration that the central force (gravity) causes the planet to accelerate towards the sun, and by the conservation of angular momentum (from his laws of motion), the area swept out by the planet remains proportional to time.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing, through a series of propositions and corollaries, that the force of gravity towards a whole planet arises from the sum of the forces towards all its parts, and that each part's force is in the reciprocal proportion of the square of the distance from that part. He further confirms this relationship using mathematical proofs (referencing Cor. 3, Prop. LXXIV, Book I; Prop. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I, and their Corollaries), and by noting that the weight of either of two mutually gravitating spheres is reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centers. This is also supported by observations of planetary motions, where the centripetal forces required to keep planets and moons in their orbits are found to follow the same inverse-square law.",
    "Newton's argument for the universality of gravitational force is based on experimental observations and induction from phenomena. He observes that all bodies near the Earth gravitate towards it in proportion to their quantity of matter, and this is affirmed by experiments (such as pendulum experiments) showing all heavy bodies fall at the same rate when air resistance is accounted for. He extends this by induction (Rule IV) to all bodies, asserting that since the quality of gravity is observed in all terrestrial bodies, it should be affirmed of all bodies whatsoever. He further notes that the mutual attraction between all celestial bodies (planets, moons, comets) is necessary to explain their motions, and that the force of gravity is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Newton insists that since gravity is found to be true for the Earth, the Moon, and other planets, and since all attraction is mutual, it must be a universal principle acting on all matter. He also stresses that propositions established by general induction from phenomena should be regarded as true until exceptions are observed, thus reinforcing the universality of gravity.",
    "Newton explains that planetary orbits are perturbed due to the mutual gravitational attractions between planets. For example, the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn causes accelerative forces of gravity between the sun, Jupiter, and Saturn, leading to differences in gravitational forces that result in perturbations of their orbits. The perturbation of the orbit of Jupiter is much less than that of Saturn, and the perturbations of the other orbits are even less, except for the Earth's orbit, which is sensibly disturbed by the moon. Newton provides ratios and proportionalities of the gravitational forces to quantify these effects, noting that the mutual attractions are the source of the observed disturbances in planetary motions.",
    "In the Principia, Newton used the method of fluxions as a mathematical tool, which is a precursor to calculus. However, he did not use standard calculus notation because, although the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus was given in the second Lemma of the second book, its algorithm or notation did not appear until published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693. Thus, in the Principia, Newton relied on geometric methods and avoided the algorithmic (algebraic) notation of calculus. Additionally, Newton was critical of handling geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations, expressing a preference for the geometrical method over algebraic or analytical methods.",
    "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by stating that bodies such as planets or projectiles are constantly drawn towards a center (such as the sun or earth) by a centripetal force. This force prevents them from moving off in a straight line, instead causing them to follow curved paths or orbits. Newton mathematically shows that if a centripetal force is directed toward a center and is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance from that center, the resulting path of the body will be a conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola) with the center of force at one focus. He also demonstrates that the areas swept out by the radius vector of the revolving body are proportional to the times, and that the centripetal force is responsible for continually deflecting the body from a rectilinear path, thereby maintaining its orbital motion.",
    "Newton analyzes motion in resisting media by considering the forces of resistance that such media (like air or fluids) impose on moving bodies. He shows that the resistance a body encounters in a fluid is often proportional to the square (duplicate ratio) of its velocity, especially in the case of swift motions through elastic fluids. Newton discusses both the theoretical and experimental aspects, noting that resistance arises from the density and properties of the medium, such as its elasticity and tenacity. He establishes mathematical propositions and corollaries for calculating the resistance encountered by bodies of various shapes (such as globes and cylinders) and explains that in a perfectly fluid and compressed medium, the resistance can be mathematically determined based on the density of the medium and the body, the velocity, and other factors. He also addresses the effects of resistance on the motion and eventual deceleration of projectiles, as well as the different behaviors in elastic versus non-elastic fluids.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in that absolute space and time exist independently of any external objects or observers. Absolute space remains always similar and immovable, while absolute time flows equably without regard to anything external and is also called duration. Relative motion, on the other hand, is the translation of a body from one relative place to another and is measured in relation to other objects or bodies considered as immovable, such as a ship or the earth. Newton supports his laws by asserting that true, absolute motion and rest can only be defined with respect to absolute space and time, not merely by their sensible measures or relations to other bodies. This distinction is important in his laws because true motion is caused and changed by impressed forces, whereas relative motion can change without any force applied to the body, simply by changing the reference frame. Newton argues that in philosophical investigations, one must abstract from the senses and consider the absolute, mathematical concepts, because relative measures can be misleading and do not capture the true causes and effects of motion.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. Two traditions were held in the family: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire, dwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, before the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe. Therefore, apart from his grandfather, no other descent of Isaac Newton is known with certainty."

The ICU room rent is limited to 4% of the SI per day (inclusive of nursing charges) as per the policy schedule. If the insured is admitted to a higher category than allowed, the insured will bear the difference for all medical expenses as per the proportionate clause.

    "For a day care cataract procedure, the claim process is as follows: \n\n1. **Claim Notification Timelines**:\n   - For planned day care treatment: Notify the TPA at least 48 hours prior to admission.\n   - For emergency hospitalisation (such as complications leading to inpatient care): Notify the TPA within 24 hours from the date of hospitalisation or before discharge, whichever is earlier.\n\n2. **Document Requirements** (for both events):\n   - Duly completed claim form.\n   - Photo ID and Age proof.\n   - Health Card, policy copy, KYC documents.\n   - Attending medical practitioner's/surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports, supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.\n   - Medical history and all previous consultation papers for the current ailment.\n   - Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n   - Original final hospital bill with detailed break-up and all original deposit/final payment receipts.\n   - Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers (e.g., lens sticker and invoice in cataract surgery).\n   - All original diagnostic reports with prescription and invoices/bills/receipts from the diagnostic center.\n   - All original medicine/pharmacy bills with prescription.\n   - Pre and post-operative imaging reports.\n   - Copy of indoor case papers with nursing sheet detailing medical history, treatment details, and progress.\n   - Cheque copy with name of proposer printed or first page of bank passbook/bank statement (not later than 3 months).\n\n3. **Submission Timelines**:\n   - For reimbursement of hospitalisation, day care, and pre-hospitalisation expenses: Submit documents within 15 days of date of discharge from hospital.\n   - For reimbursement of post-hospitalisation expenses: Submit within 15 days from completion of post-hospitalisation treatment.\n\n4. **For Non-Network Hospitalisation**:\n   - Payment must be made upfront by the insured and claims are to be submitted for reimbursement with all required documents within the prescribed time limit.\n\n5. **Process**:\n   - The TPA/insurer will scrutinise the claim form and documents, request for any deficiency to be rectified, and settle or repudiate the claim within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document. Claims for pre- and post-hospitalisation will only be processed after the main hospitalisation claim is approved.\n\nIn summary, both the day care cataract procedure and the subsequent inpatient hospitalisation for complications require timely notification to the TPA, submission of the same set of documents (with surgery-specific documents like lens stickers/invoices for cataract), and adherence to the 15-day submission window after discharge for reimbursement claims.",
    "According to the policy, 'New Born Baby' means a baby born during the Policy period and aged up to 90 days. New Born Babies will be accepted for cover (subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover) from birth if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted. Acceptance of New Born Babies as Insured Persons is subject to written notification on or before the last day of the month following the birth of the child and receipt of the agreed premium. Therefore, if the insured mother had opted for maternity cover and the newborn was notified and the required premium paid as specified, the newborn's intensive care treatment expenses would be eligible for claim under the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, subject to the policy limits and terms. However, if the newborn was not formally accepted as an insured person (notification and premium not completed as per the process), claims for the newborn's expenses would not be admissible. Definitions and exclusions do not specifically exclude newborn intensive care if these conditions are met, so claim eligibility exists provided all procedural requirements are fulfilled.",
    "No, the provided documentation is not sufficient for a claim for inpatient psychiatric treatment. As per the policy, a 'Psychiatrist' must be a medical practitioner with a recognized post-graduate degree or diploma in psychiatry, or be otherwise recognized by the relevant authorities. While a Clinical Psychologist is recognized as a Mental Healthcare Professional, for the purposes of claim documentation, the requirements specify an 'attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/ nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, investigation test reports etc. supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.' A general practitioner's prescription and a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist do not meet the requirement for documentation from a qualified psychiatrist or eligible medical practitioner as per policy definitions. Therefore, for inpatient psychiatric claims, certification/diagnosis must come from a psychiatrist as defined, and supporting documents must be as per claim document rules.",
    "According to the document, oral chemotherapy is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period (with an additional special condition that modern treatments, including oral chemotherapy, are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured). Regarding consumables such as ECG electrodes and gloves, the policy states that all non-medical expenses, including items for personal comfort not consistent with or incidental to the diagnosis and treatment, are not admissible and refers to Annexure I 'Non-Medical Expenses' for the complete list. As per standard industry annexures, ECG electrodes and gloves are typically listed as non-admissible consumables unless used during surgery or as part of a covered daycare procedure and specifically prescribed. Since the policy explicitly excludes non-medical consumables unless prescribed by a medical practitioner as part of hospitalisation or daycare, and since oral chemotherapy is a daycare procedure, gloves and ECG electrodes may only be admissible if their use is medically necessary, prescribed by the treating doctor, and directly related to the procedure. If not explicitly prescribed or if used for routine care, they are not admissible.",
    "According to the policy, pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation medical expenses are reimbursed if they relate to an illness or injury for which an in-patient hospitalisation claim has been accepted (Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2). Pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred up to the number of days and amount limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance before admission can be claimed, provided they are related to the same illness. Post-hospitalisation expenses incurred within the pre-defined number of days after discharge and up to the amount limit can also be claimed, provided they are for the same condition and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible (see definition of 'Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses'). Therefore, both the pre-hospitalisation expenses from 18 days before admission and the post-hospitalisation diagnostics and pharmacy expenses 20 days after discharge can be claimed, as long as they fall within the number of days and amount limits specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance, and are for the same illness.

However, the deletion of an insured person due to age occurs upon the dependent ceasing to be a dependent (Clause B. Termination for Insured Person's cover, iv), unless specifically agreed otherwise for continuation till the end of the policy period. If no such agreement is made, coverage for the child terminates immediately when they turn 27. The policyholder can request deletion, and this is processed with refund of premium on a pro-rata basis if no claims are paid or outstanding (see Endorsements and Termination clauses).",
    "If the insured is admitted to a room with rates exceeding the room rent limit mentioned in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance, the reimbursement/payment of all associated medical expenses (including diagnostic and specialist fees) incurred at the hospital will be effected in the same proportion as the admissible rate per day bears to the actual rate per day of room rent. This is due to the Proportionate Clause. Relevant clause: Note 1 of Clause III.A.1.A. Proportionate Deductions shall not be applied in respect of hospitals where differential billing is not followed or for expenses where differential billing is not adopted based on the room category.",

    "Eligibility criteria for adding a new employee, their spouse, and sibling mid-policy are as follows: \n- Employee: Must be an employee of the policyholder (employer/employee relationship) and part of the group as defined by IRDAI guidelines. \n- Spouse: The legal spouse or life partner (including live-in partner) as declared at the time of inception of the policy (no change during the policy period; change can be requested at renewal). \n- Sibling: Employee's sibling can be covered up to age 26, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. \nDocumentation/process: The employer must provide written information required to process the addition, including a complete list of members at the time of policy issuance/renewal and periodic updates on member entry/exit. For mid-policy addition, an application for cover must be submitted, additional premium on a pro-rata basis paid for the duration of risk coverage, and an endorsement confirming the addition must be issued by the insurer. Additional information/documents/premium may be requested by the underwriter as needed.",
    "Robotic surgery for cancer (malignancy) is covered under both day care and inpatient hospitalization, subject to sub-limits as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. For modern treatment methods, including robotic surgeries for malignancies, the limit per surgery is up to the specified limit in the policy documents. Additionally, under the special conditions, 12 modern treatments as per IRDAI (including robotic surgery) are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI). Therefore, whether robotic surgery for cancer is performed as a day care procedure or inpatient hospitalization, coverage is subject to a maximum of 50% of the SI or the limit specified in the policy schedule/certificate, whichever is applicable.",
    "If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, the following steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment: \n\n1. Pre-Authorization for Air Ambulance Evacuation:\n- The Insured Person must notify the insurance company immediately either at the call centre or in writing about the need for emergency evacuation and repatriation.\n- Emergency medical evacuations must be pre-authorized by the insurer. The team of specialists, in association with the emergency assistance service provider, will determine the medical necessity of such evacuation or repatriation, after which approval will be given.\n\n2. Claims Assessment and Mandatory Requirements:\n- The Insured Person must submit the air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider as documentation.\n- Upon hospital admission, the Insured Person must follow the standard claims procedure, which includes notifying the insurer/TPA within 24 hours of emergency hospitalization or before discharge (whichever is earlier), and providing all relevant information, including policy number and plan of treatment.\n- The claim must be supported with the following original documents submitted within the prescribed time limit: (i) duly completed claim form; (ii) photo ID and age proof; (iii) health card, policy copy, photo ID, KYC documents; (iv) attending medical practitioner's/surgeon's certificate regarding diagnosis/nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis and investigation test reports supported by the prescription from the attending medical practitioner.\n- For cashless claims, the insured must present their ID card at the network hospital and complete a cashless request form for pre-authorization.\n- For reimbursement, all necessary documents (including air ambulance ticket and hospital records) must be submitted to the TPA within the prescribed time limit.\n- The insurer will assess the claim documents, and claims will be settled or repudiated within 15 days of receipt of the last necessary document.\n- All reasonable cooperation, including authorizations to obtain medical and other records, must be provided to the insurer/TPA as required for claim processing.",
    "If an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and recently ported to this policy, the waiting period for a specific illness (such as knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. As per the Pre-Existing Disease Waiting Period (Code-Excl01) clause iii: 'If the Insured Person is continuously covered without any break as defined under the portability norms of the extant IRDAI (Insurance Product) Regulations 2024, then waiting period for the same would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage.' For specific waiting periods (Code-Excl02), the longer of the two waiting periods (pre-existing disease or specific condition) applies if applicable. The insured must have declared the pre-existing condition at application and it must be accepted by the insurer.",
    "No, the expense for an imported medication not normally used in India as part of inpatient treatment will not be covered if it is considered unproven or experimental. According to the definition of 'Unproven/Experimental Treatment': 'the treatment, including drug experimental therapy, which is not based on established medical practice in India, is treatment experimental or unproven.' Also, under Permanent Exclusions & Waiting Periods, clause 16 (Unproven Treatments, Code-Excl16): 'Expenses related to any unproven treatment, services and supplies for or in connection with any treatment. Unproven treatments are treatments, procedures or supplies that lack significant medical documentation to support their effectiveness.' Coverage is only provided for 'Medically Necessary Treatment' as defined, which must be based on established medical practice in India.",
    "The document does not provide specific information regarding the continuation of coverage for dependents or options for continued coverage following the death of a member in a non-employer group policy.",
    "For claims involving implanted devices such as cardiac stents, the policy requires submission of the original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries (e.g., lens sticker and invoice in cataract surgery, stent invoice and sticker in angioplasty surgery). If only a generic invoice is provided without the implant sticker, the claim may be deficient in required documentation. The claim could be delayed, partially paid, or potentially denied until the necessary implant sticker is submitted, as the insurer reserves the right to scrutinize documents and deduct or reject claims lacking required documents.",
    "Home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the charges are for services from a registered nursing service provider. The documentation required includes bills from the registered nursing service provider. The policy also specifies that only bills/invoices/medical treatment-related documents in the insured person's name for whom the claim is submitted will be accepted. Therefore, to qualify for reimbursement, the spouse must be the insured person, and the documentation (bills) must be in their name and from a registered provider.",
    "In the case of multiple policies taken by an Insured Person to indemnify treatment costs, the Insured Person can file for claim settlement as per his/her choice under any policy, and the insurer of that chosen policy shall be treated as the primary insurer. If the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary insurer shall seek the details of other available policies of the policyholder and coordinate with the other insurers to ensure settlement of the balance amount as per the policy conditions, provided a written request for the same has been submitted by the Insured Person. Required documentation includes submitting a written request to the primary insurer and providing details of other available policies.",
    "Based on the document, the policy covers 'Medical Expenses incurred on Medically Necessary Treatment of the Insured Person' and specifies that expenses must be incurred on the written Medical Advice of a Medical Practitioner and for Medically Necessary Treatment. While the policy does include coverage for 'cost of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures directly related to the Injury/Illness for which the Insured Person is hospitalised,' these are only claimable if they are part of a medically necessary treatment for an illness or injury. If the hospitalization was solely for evaluation, and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a decision for no treatment, the expenses may not be claimable as per the intent of the policy. The emphasis on 'Medically Necessary Treatment' suggests that mere evaluation without subsequent treatment may not fulfill the criteria for a payable claim unless the evaluation was deemed necessary as part of the process to treat a suspected illness or injury. There is no explicit exclusion for negative findings, but the claim would be assessed on whether the hospitalization and investigations were medically necessary for a suspected condition as per the attending physician's advice.",
    "The document states that the Insured Person is required at the inception of the policy to make a nomination for the purpose of payment of claims under the policy in the event of death of the policyholder. Any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and such change shall be effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made. Therefore, if the previous nominee has suddenly died and there is no prior endorsement for a nominee change, the insured (or policyholder) must notify the insurer in writing to update the nominee details. The change will become effective only after the insurer makes an endorsement on the policy. Until the endorsement is made, the last valid nomination on record (if any) will be considered for any claim settlement. If there is no subsisting nominee at the time of a claim (such as death of both policyholder and nominee), the document provides that payment will be made to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder, whose discharge shall be treated as full and final discharge of the insurer's liability under the policy.",

    "No, expenses will not be reimbursed in this case. According to the policy, a 'hospital' must be registered as a hospital with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 or other specified enactments, or must meet certain minimum criteria. Even if qualified practitioners are present, if the AYUSH hospital is not registered locally as required, it does not meet the policy's definition of 'hospital,' and therefore expenses incurred there are not reimbursable.",
    "If there is any change in the diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost of treatment during hospitalization, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA, as described in the policy. This is necessary to maintain cashless eligibility. The updated details must match the actual treatment received, and the authorization process must be repeated with the revised information.",
    "According to the policy, pre-hospitalisation medical expenses are only covered on a reimbursement basis provided that a claim for in-patient hospitalisation under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2 has been accepted. The assessment sequence outlined in the policy requires that the in-patient hospitalisation claim is first accepted before pre-hospitalisation expenses related to the same illness or injury can be reimbursed. Therefore, if a claim for pre-hospitalisation expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalisation claim has been approved, it will not be processed or reimbursed until the main inpatient hospitalisation claim is approved.",

    "Domiciliary hospitalization means medical treatment for a period exceeding three days for an illness/disease/injury which would normally require care and treatment at a hospital but is actually taken at home under the following circumstances: (a) the condition of the patient is such that he/she is not in a condition to be removed to a hospital, or (b) the patient takes treatment at home due to non-availability of a room in a hospital.

    "Ambulance services are covered under the policy for shifting a patient from residence to hospital in case of admission in Emergency Ward/I.C.U., or from one Hospital/Nursing Home to another Hospital/Nursing Home by registered ambulance only for better medical facilities. The reimbursement limit for ambulance services is 1% of the sum insured or Rs 2000/-, whichever is less.",
    "Telemedicine: The policy reimburses reasonable expenses incurred by the insured on telemedicine/teleconsultation with a registered medical practitioner for diagnosis and treatment of a disease/illness covered under the policy. The maximum limit payable for telemedicine is Rs. 2,000 per insured and/or per family for a policy period. The telemedicine services must comply with the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines dated 25th March 2020 by MCI (and as amended from time to time).\n\nMaternity Expenses and Newborn Child Cover Benefit Extension: This is an optional cover available on payment of 10% of the total basic premium for all insured persons under the policy. The option must be exercised at the policy's inception and cannot be canceled for a refund during the policy period. Insured persons with two or more living children are not eligible. Claims are considered for only the first two children per insured person. The maximum benefit allowable is up to Rs. 50,000, which is part of the basic sum insured. The benefits are admissible only if expenses are incurred as in-patients in India, with a 9-month waiting period for normal/caesarean delivery (can be relaxed for accidents or emergencies). Pre-natal and post-natal expenses are covered only if admitted and treated in a hospital/nursing home. Pre- and post-hospitalization benefits are not available under this section. The newborn child is covered from day one up to three months for in-patient hospital treatment, subject to the specified maternity sum insured.",
    "The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is 36 months of continuous coverage after the date of inception of the first policy with the insurer or its reinstatement.

If the sum insured is enhanced, the waiting periods apply afresh to the increased portion. If the insured is continuously covered without a break under portability norms, waiting periods are reduced to the extent of prior coverage."
